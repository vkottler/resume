\frametitle{Hyperloop II: Dashboard}
The following slides include screenshots of the web-based dashboard I created
to monitor and control our pod for the second hyperloop competition (Summer 2017).
\break

The embedded system is one
\HREF{https://www.digikey.com/products/en/development-boards-kits-programmers/evaluation-boards-embedded-mcu-dsp/786}{STM32 Nucleo 144 F767ZI} 
microcontroller development board. We wrote all of the firmware
\HREF{https://github.com/madison-embedded/gcc-builds}{from-scratch}
and used \HREF{https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/}{LwIP} to implement the network stack.
\break

The ``terminal'' shown in the following slides is ``redirected \texttt{stdout}'' from
the microcontroller, not an SSH session or userspace Linux program.
\break

Bootstrapping the microcontroller's serial terminal to a web-based UI is
the key feature of this UI.
