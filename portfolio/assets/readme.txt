Software Projects

	- Badgerloop Website, Wiki
		(https://github.com/badgerloop-software/website)
		(https://badgerloop.com)
		(wiki.badgerloop.com)

		I started badgerloop.com from scratch, right now we are working on
		an interface for managing all of the different content on the site
		as it needs to change. The biggest challenge right now is a file
		upload and retrieval API.

		I also set up a MediaWiki instance for the team to try and start
		a new paradigm of maintaining organization to hopefully save
		time in the long-run and help keep less involved members up to
		date.

	- Personal Website
		(https://github.com/vkottler/personal-homepage)
		(http://vaughnsplayground.me)

		My first challenging web development project. The most interesting
		part about it is probably the modal that shows a list of the
		videos from my YouTube channel.

	- Bare-metal Microcontroller Programming with make + GCC
		(https://github.com/madison-embedded/gcc-builds)

		Embedded programming in C/C++ is definitely my passion. I enjoy
		the intimate level of control one has and how challenging it can
		be to debug issues. I don't know if there is a better exercise
		in truly understanding computing problems at their core than.

	- LaTeX Assets
	 	(https://github.com/vkottler/resume)

		I have recently discovered LaTeX and am trying to setup a comfortable
		document-creation workflow. It has been a struggle to write LaTeX
		that is not cryptic as it is a huge ecosystem of utility that I
		am not familiar with yet but so far I am enjoying writing source
		in the editor of my choice and compiling it with single commands
		via make.
