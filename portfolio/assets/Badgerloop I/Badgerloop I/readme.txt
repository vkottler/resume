This was my first experience as an engineer being in well over-my-head.

A multi-microcontroller system architecture was very difficult to write code
for as a completely green embedded programmer.

CAN is a light-weight protocol but it wasn't until very late in the game
that I realized I would need my own application-layer implementation, but
developing this was probably the highlight of the experience and lessons
learned.

This was also my first experience attempting to diagram a system in
an abstract way.

This took place during my second year of college.
