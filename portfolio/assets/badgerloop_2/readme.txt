This project was very draining, as a team we only had two electrical engineers
who could work on harnessing and test circuitry and two computer engineers
(myself one of them) who could write the microcontroller firmware.

In additon, I was the lead of the Software Team which ended up just being
myself. As a result, the dashboard is very limited and was written in a 
fraction of the time that the microcontroller firmware was developed in.

I also created the schematics and board layouts for two of our three PCBs.

In the end we had a pod that may have been ready for the full run but
it was not tested very thoroughly and had almost no navigation capability.

The lessons learned in navigation is that a cheap IMU becomes a significant
bottleneck. I would like to learn more about how to solve the problem
of navigation for hyperloop, which is something I will work on when I get
back to school.
