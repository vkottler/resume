Dear {\color{pri-600}\textbf{SpaceX}},

\noindent\break
I am currently a Firmware Engineer working in the autonomous robotics /
warehouse automation problem domain.

\noindent\break
Electronic/programmable systems that directly interface with humans have
practical safety considerations, as a result I have gained experience in
developing embedded software that complies with industrial standards at
a negotiated integrity level.

\noindent\break
My experience as an intern at SpaceX familiarized me with problem-domain
invariant attributes of a workflow that is viable for real-time,
safety-critical systems' development.

\noindent\break
As an engineer contributing new assets to an existing ecosystem, I find myself
motivated to improve the efficiency of my workflow. As a result I have
championed build system improvements and custom in-circuit debugging tooling
to meet the demand of a real-time embedded system that increases in complexity
as it scales.

{\begin{textblock}{8}(1,8)\noindent
Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to your feedback,\break\break
{\color{pri-600}\textbf{Vaughn Kottler}}\break\break\break
