Dear {\color{maroon}\textbf{SpaceX}},

\vspace{1in}

\noindent\break
I expect to graduate at the end of the year and believe I have prepared
myself for a meaningful role in your software organization.

\noindent\break
My two, three-month internships with the Texas Software team exposed me to
hard problems, efficient workflows, and brilliant engineers. Starting a career
in this environment with the opportunity to contribute to one of humanity's
most ambitious ventures has been my goal throughout my undergraduate career.

\noindent\break
My self evaluation includes the ability to acclimate to new contexts quickly
by drawing from a rich set of experiences. I have worked in many different
layers of software and hardware stacks and enjoy the interface between the
two the most.

\noindent\break
The leadership I have worked under and mentorship I have received as a student
has helped me understand how effective engineers give and receive feedback,
articulate the status of their work, express their concerns and contribute
to healthy company culture. I feel that I have the communication skills and
a personality that, together, make me a lucrative candidate.

\noindent\break
I hope that you consider evaluating me as a future member of your team!

{\begin{textblock}{8}(1,8)\noindent
Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to your feedback,\break\break
{\color{maroon}\textbf{Vaughn Kottler}}\break\break\break
